# Sign up form

[Live demo](https://lbackman.github.io/sign-up-form/)

The object of this exercise was to practice making and styling form elements in HTML and CSS.

Special error messages were made for entering an invalid email address and for entering a
password with less than eight characters.

I didn't bother to validate that the password entered in the confirmation field is the same
as in the previous field. That would require JavaScript, which will be covered in an upcoming
course.

What I did learn was:
- Forms
- Input types and attributes
- CSS advanced selectors
- Pseudo elements and pseudo classes
- Custom properties
- CSS functions
- Absolute and relative positioning
- How to add a custom font
